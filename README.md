Senior Project - 402

The purpose of this project was to throw myself out of my comfort zone. So I decided to use the
Microsoft Kinect and program in C#.

The goal of the project itself is to create a ballet teacher for use in a game-like setting. Since
ballet is very methodical I figured it would be the easiest dance form to teach using a computer
rather than a human being.

I have been told many times that this project is too ambitious so at this time, I'm not hoping to
be able to teach a user to be a prima ballerina, but rather give them a solid basis in ballet
by teaching good habits.
